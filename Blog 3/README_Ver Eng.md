# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. The Urgency of the Topic

In the problem of fraud transaction detection, the biggest challenge lies not only in the algorithm but also in the nature of the data. The extreme imbalance between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, along with sophisticated behaviors concealed under various payment methods, is a major concern. Machine learning models (such as Random Forest or XGBoost) can only achieve optimal performance when the input data is cleaned and accurately reflects the nature of fraudulent behavior. Therefore, feature engineering, or the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features, helps models understand anomalous patterns and significantly improves their performance.

## 1.2. Project Objectives

Instead of focusing on fine-tuning model parameters, this project focuses on optimizing the quality of input data. Specific objectives include:

**EDA (Exploratory Data Analytics.** Explore hidden relationships between variables to uncover traces of fraudulent behavior on the dataset.

**Feature Engineering.** Constructing new variables from raw data to enhance the algorithm's classification capabilities.

**Evaluate effectiveness.** Perform comparative analysis (A/B testing).aboveThis model demonstrates the importance of data processing. Specifically, in this project, the team will compare the model's performance when trained on raw data versus processed data and feature extraction.

## 1.3. Scope of the Project

The project uses a simulated dataset [PaySim](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1?fbclid=IwY2xjawQt4IpleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFRQTVMTUtUMEwzR2JFcWZKc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHt2IJf88BNasTaUnRoEMgKLebwUkbTMWUHinH0pQVV7yfgX2wPPrvsJxk9iN_aem_mbURNxMBhP1k6Iphu4y0XA). Focusing on processes such as data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering, then using powerful algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost as measurement tools for verification.

# 2. Dataset Description
## 2.1. Data Structure
Each row in the dataset represents a single financial transaction. The data captures key information such as the transaction timestamp, transaction type, amount, and the account balances of both the sender and the receiver before and after the transaction.

A few sample rows are illustrated below:
#### Sample Transactions
The following examples are extracted from the PaySim dataset to demonstrate the structure of a typical transaction:
| step | type     | amount   | nameOrig     | oldbalanceOrg | newbalanceOrig | nameDest     | oldbalanceDest | newbalanceDest | isFraud | isFlaggedFraud |
|------|----------|----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| 1    | PAYMENT  | 9839.64  | C1231006815  | 170136.0       | 160296.36      | M1979787155  | 0.0            | 0.0            | 0      | 0              |
| 1    | PAYMENT  | 1864.28  | C1666544295  | 21249.0        | 19384.72       | M2044282225  | 0.0            | 0.0            | 0      | 0              |
| 1    | TRANSFER | 181.00   | C1305486145  | 181.0          | 0.0            | C553264065   | 0.0            | 0.0            | 1      | 0              |
| 1    | CASH_OUT | 181.00   | C840083671   | 181.0          | 0.0            | C38997010    | 21182.0        | 0.0            | 1      | 0              |
| 1    | PAYMENT  | 11668.14 | C2048537720  | 41554.0        | 29885.86       | M1230701703  | 0.0            | 0.0            | 0      | 0              |

**Quick observations:**
- Fraudulent transactions (isFraud = 1) often occur in categories such as TRANSFER or CASH_OUT.
- Some transactions result in the sender’s balance dropping to zero immediately — a potentially suspicious pattern that models should learn to detect.

Overall, the dataset does more than store isolated transactions; it captures money flow and balance transitions, which is highly valuable for detecting anomalous behavior.

## 2.2. Feature Explanation
One of the strengths of the PaySim dataset lies in its intuitive and realistic feature design. This allows practitioners not only to train models but also to understand the underlying financial behavior reflected in the data.

The amount variable represents the transaction value and is one of the most critical features. In real-world scenarios, fraudulent transactions often involve unusual amounts — either significantly larger than typical user behavior or deliberately fragmented to avoid detection.

The step variable denotes time in hours, spanning roughly 30 days. This enables time-series analysis, such as identifying accounts that perform multiple transactions within a short period — a common fraud pattern.

Balance-related features, including oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, oldbalanceDest, and newbalanceDest, are particularly important for modeling money flow. Instead of looking at transactions in isolation, these variables capture the financial state before and after each transaction. For example, an account being drained to zero or a recipient account receiving funds without a clear prior balance can both signal suspicious activity.

Additionally, the type feature categorizes transactions into groups such as PAYMENT, TRANSFER, and CASH_OUT. This is useful because different transaction types carry different risk levels. In practice, TRANSFER and CASH_OUT are more frequently associated with fraudulent behavior than standard payment transactions.

Overall, these features provide not only quantitative data but also behavioral insights, forming a strong foundation for advanced feature engineering in later stages.

## 2.3. Target Variable
In this problem, isFraud serves as the target variable. It defines a binary classification task, where each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

While this may seem straightforward, predicting fraud is inherently challenging. A robust model must not only detect as many fraudulent transactions as possible but also minimize false alarms on legitimate ones. This is especially critical in financial systems, where excessive false positives can frustrate users and erode trust.

In essence, the task involves balancing two competing objectives: maximizing fraud detection (high recall) while maintaining acceptable precision. For this reason, evaluation metrics go beyond accuracy and include precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 2.4. Key Challenge: Class Imbalance
One of the biggest challenges in this dataset is class imbalance. Fraudulent transactions account for only a tiny fraction of the data — typically less than 1% — while the vast majority are legitimate.

This creates a misleading scenario where a model can achieve high accuracy by simply predicting all transactions as non-fraudulent. For instance, if 99% of transactions are legitimate, a model that always predicts 0 will achieve 99% accuracy, yet completely fail at detecting fraud.

As a result, accuracy is not a reliable metric in this context. Instead, recall (fraud detection capability) and F1-score (balance between precision and recall) become far more meaningful. A good model should minimize missed fraud cases, even at the cost of some false positives.

To address this issue, imbalance handling techniques are applied during preprocessing. Oversampling methods such as SMOTE can be used to increase the number of fraud samples, while undersampling reduces the number of legitimate ones. Combining these approaches helps the model better learn patterns from the minority class and improves real-world fraud detection performance.

## 2.5. Preliminary Remarks
Overall, PaySim is a well-structured and accessible dataset with sufficient information to model financial behavior effectively. It serves as a solid foundation for building baseline fraud detection systems.

However, it is important to note that PaySim is a synthetic dataset. As such, fraud patterns may be simplified compared to real-world scenarios. Additionally, it lacks important contextual features such as location, device information, and long-term behavioral history, and it does not fully capture real-time system dynamics.

These limitations should be carefully considered when evaluating the model’s applicability to real-world financial environments.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of examining, visualizing, and summarizing the main characteristics of a raw dataset. EDA helps to better understand the structure, detect errors, outliers, and relationships between variables before building a model.

By conducting a basic data inspection, we observe that the dataset has the following characteristics:

- The total size of the dataset is (6362620, 11)
- The data does not contain any NaN values
- There are two columns containing object-type data: type, nameOrig, nameDest

```python
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
df.shape
df.isnull().sum()
df.info()
```
```python
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 6362620 entries, 0 to 6362619
Data columns (total 11 columns):
 #   Column          Dtype  
---  ------          -----  
 0   step            int64  
 1   type            object 
 2   amount          float64
 3   nameOrig        object 
 4   oldbalanceOrg   float64
 5   newbalanceOrig  float64
 6   nameDest        object 
 7   oldbalanceDest  float64
 8   newbalanceDest  float64
 9   isFraud         int64  
 10  isFlaggedFraud  int64  
dtypes: float64(5), int64(3), object(3)
```

With the size (6362620, 11), we can see that this dataset is not too large but still contains a significant amount of information and features. Therefore, we need to analyze each feature to understand the relationships between them.

## 3.1. Transaction type analysis

By examining transactions labeled as Fraud and Valid, we check which transaction types are considered valid and which are considered fraudulent.

```python
# Split data into Fraud and Valid
data_new = df.copy()

fraud = data_new[data_new["isFraud"] == 1]
valid = data_new[data_new["isFraud"] == 0]

print("Fraud transactions by type: \n",fraud.type.value_counts())
print("\n Valid transactions by type: \n",valid.type.value_counts())
```

We obtain the following results:
```python
Fraud transactions by type: 
 type
CASH_OUT    4116
TRANSFER    4097
Name: count, dtype: int64

 Valid transactions by type: 
 type
CASH_OUT    2233384
PAYMENT     2151495
CASH_IN     1399284
TRANSFER     528812
DEBIT         41432
Name: count, dtype: int64
```

From the analysis, we observe that the dataset contains transaction types: CASH_IN, CASH_OUT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER, and DEBIT. Among these, the two transaction types identified as fraud are CASH_OUT and TRANSFER. Therefore, we will focus on analyzing fraud and valid data for these two transaction types.

```python
# Focus on TRANSFER and CASH_OUT
valid = valid[(valid["type"] == "CASH_OUT")| (valid["type"] == "TRANSFER")]
data_new = data_new[(data_new["type"] == "CASH_OUT") | (data_new["type"] == "TRANSFER")]
```

## 3.2. Balance analysis

One of the important indicators reflecting whether a transaction is legitimate or suspicious is the account balance after the transaction. For example, a normal transaction should have a balance equal to the previous balance minus the transaction amount. We calculate the transaction error for the sender account (denoted as Orig) and the receiver account (denoted as Dest):

```python
data_new['errorOrig'] = data_new['oldbalanceOrg'] - data_new['amount'] - data_new['newbalanceOrig']
data_new['errorDest'] = data_new['oldbalanceDest'] + data_new['amount'] - data_new['newbalanceDest']

# Analyze these values to see the distribution of non 0 and 0 cases
# Define threshold for "zero"
threshold = 1e-6

# Origin
data_new['isErrorOrig'] = (~np.isclose(data_new['errorOrig'], 0, atol=threshold)).astype(int)

# Destination
data_new['isErrorDest'] = (~np.isclose(data_new['errorDest'], 0, atol=threshold)).astype(int)

print("Origin Error Counts:")
print(data_new['isErrorOrig'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100)

print("\nDestination Error Counts:")
print(data_new['isErrorDest'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100)
```
The results are:
```python
Origin Error Counts:
isErrorOrig
1    90.518079
0     9.481921
Name: proportion, dtype: float64

Destination Error Counts:
isErrorDest
0    71.075859
1    28.924141
Name: proportion, dtype: float64
```
From the analysis, we observe that errors occur frequently in Origin; both fraud and non-fraud transactions show balance inconsistencies. Therefore, most cases appear suspicious, and using Origin may not accurately reflect the relationship between fraud and non-fraud transactions.

Meanwhile, for Destination, only 29% of cases show balance errors. This suggests that using Destination may make it easier to identify suspicious transactions.

Next, we examine cases with and without errors against fraud and non-fraud labels:

```python
pd.crosstab(data_new['isErrorDest'], data_new['isFraud'], normalize='columns') * 100
pd.crosstab(data_new['isErrorOrig'], data_new['isFraud'], normalize='columns') * 100
```

The results are:

| isErrorDest | isFraud=0 | isFraud=1 |
| :---------: | :-------: | :--------: |
| 0 | 71.166528 | 40.582004 |
| 1 | 28.833472 | 59.417996 |

| isErrorOrig | isFraud=0 | isFraud=1 |
| :---------: | :-------: | :--------: |
| 0 | 9.214408 | 99.452088 |
| 1 | 90.785592 | 0.547912 |

**Analysis of isErrorDest:**
- When error = 1:
  * Fraud: 59% -> Fraud transactions have a higher error rate
  * Non-fraud: 29% 

- When error = 0:
  * Fraud: 40%
  * Non-fraud: 71% -> Normal transactions have fewer errors

*This analysis shows that fraud transactions are often associated with balance inconsistencies at the Destination. The error rate in fraud cases is roughly twice that of normal transactions.*

-> This indicates that isErrorDest is a strong feature for distinguishing between normal and abnormal transactions. isErrorDest=1 is associated with fraud transactions, while isErrorDest=0 corresponds to non-fraud.

**Analysis of isErrorDest:**
- With error = 1:
  * Fraud: 99% -> Fraud transactions almost never have errors
  * Non-fraud: 0.5%

- With error = 0:
  * Fraud: 90% -> Normal transactions have higher error occurrence
  * Non-fraud: 9% 

*This suggests that in fraud transactions, balance errors are nearly absent, meaning balances are carefully adjusted to avoid detection (when relying on post-transaction balance checks). In contrast, non-fraud transactions tend to have higher error rates*

-> This indicates that isErrorOrig is also a potential feature for distinguishing transactions. isErrorOrig=1 corresponds to non-fraud, while isErrorOrig=0 corresponds to fraud.

</p>

**Conclusion:** isErrorOrig and isErrorDest will be added to the dataset as features.

## 3.3. Analysis of isFlaggedFraud

isFlaggedFraud describes transactions exceeding 200,000 units that are flagged as fraud. This is a rule-based feature (a simulation within this dataset). We examine how many transactions are flagged under this rule:

```python
# Check how many observations are flagged as Fraud
flagged = data_new[data_new["isFlaggedFraud"] == 1]
flagged_correctly = sum(flagged["isFraud"] == 1)
flagged_wrongly = len(flagged) - flagged_correctly
total = flagged_correctly + flagged_wrongly

print(flagged_correctly," observations were flagged correctly and ", flagged_wrongly, \
      " observations were flagged wrongly for a total of ", total, " flagged observations.")

# Check how many observations where the transaction is fraudulent, the transaction is a transfer and the amount is greater than 200, 000 are in the dataset
should_be_flagged = fraud[(fraud["amount"] > 200000) & (fraud["type"] == "TRANSFER")]
print("Number of observations that should be flagged: ", len(should_be_flagged))
```

The results are:
```python
16 observations were flagged correctly and 0 observations were flagged wrongly for a total of  16  flagged observations.
Number of observations that should be flagged: 2740
```

From the analysis, only 16 cases were correctly flagged, while there are actually 2740 transactions exceeding 200,000 units that were not flagged by the system.

**Conclusion:** isFlaggedFraud does not accurately reflect transaction characteristics. Therefore, it is not an important feature and will be dropped.

## 3.4. Analysis of nameOrig and nameDest

nameOrig and nameDest represent the sender and receiver account names. From the analysis, these columns do not provide meaningful information for the dataset, so they will be removed.

## 3.5. Analysis of amount and step

For amount, we examine its distribution for fraud and non-fraud cases:

```python
sns.boxplot(x='isFraud', y='amount', data=data_new)
plt.yscale('log')
plt.title('Amount vs Fraud')
plt.show()
```
<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/EvelynMyNguyen210/Warmup02_Debug_Team/blob/main/Collection_Blog3/Amount_vs_fraud.bmp style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;"><br/>
  <em>Figure 3.3. Distribution of amount for fraud and non-fraud</em>
</p>

From the plot, transaction amounts range from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup>. Fraud transactions tend to have higher amounts than non-fraud, but there is still overlap between the two groups. Therefore, there is no clear separation between fraud and non-fraud based solely on amount.

Next, analyzing transactions over time, we observe that fraud occurs relatively consistently, with slight spikes around step ranges 0–100 and around 400.

For valid transactions, most occur between steps 0–60 and 100–400.

```python
bins = 50

valid.hist(column="step",color="green",bins=bins)
plt.xlabel("1 hour time step")
plt.ylabel("# of transactions")
plt.title("# of valid transactions over time")

fraud.hist(column ="step",color="red",bins=bins)
plt.xlabel("1 hour time step")
plt.ylabel("# of transactions")
plt.title("# of fraud transactions over time")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

<p align="center">

  <em>Figure 3.5. Distribution of fraud transactions over time</em>
</p>

To better analyze fraud timing, we convert time into hours and examine patterns within a 24-hour cycle:

```python
data_new['hour'] = data_new['step'] % 24
sns.barplot(x='hour', y='isFraud', data=data_new)
plt.title('Fraud Rate by Hour')
plt.show()
```

<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/EvelynMyNguyen210/Warmup02_Debug_Team/blob/main/Collection_Blog3/Fraud_rate_by_Hour.bmp style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;"><br/>
  <em>Figure 3.6. Distribution of fraud transactions by hour (24h)</em>
</p>

The plot shows that fraud transactions mainly occur between 2 AM and 8 AM. Therefore, this is an effective feature for distinguishing fraud from valid transactions.

From the analysis, amount remains an important feature since fraud transactions tend to involve larger amounts. While step alone does not provide clear insights, converting it into a 24-hour feature reveals meaningful patterns. Therefore, we will add the hour column and drop the step column.

|         |     type |     amount | oldbalanceOrg | newbalanceOrig | oldbalanceDest | newbalanceDest | isFraud |  errorOrig |     errorDest | isErrorOrig | isErrorDest | hour |

# 4. Data Preprocessing
## 4.1. Data Encoding

Before feeding data into the model, feature values must be converted into numerical form. In the current dataset, the type column is the only column containing string values (CASH_OUT, TRANSFER). Here, we use one-hot encoding to convert it into numerical data.

```python
# Seperate feature (X) and target (y)
X = data_new.drop(columns=['isFraud'])
y = data_new['isFraud']

# Apply one hot encoding to type feature
X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=['type'], drop_first=True)
```

## 4.2. Train-test split

Before training, we split the dataset into two parts: train and test. This ensures the model can generalize to new data and prevents overfitting. It ensures the model learns patterns instead of memorizing data.

We split 80% for training and 20% for testing. We also set stratify=y to maintain class distribution, which is crucial because the dataset is highly imbalanced (fraud rate ~0.1%).

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y,
    test_size=0.2,       # 80% train, 20% test
    random_state=42,
    stratify=y           # VERY IMPORTANT for imbalance
)

## 4.3. Handling imbalance

Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, the model may fail to detect fraud if not handled properly. Therefore, we apply oversampling.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is a machine learning technique used to handle imbalanced datasets by generating synthetic samples for the minority class. Instead of duplicating data, SMOTE interpolates between nearby data points, helping the model learn better and reducing overfitting.

We apply SMOTE to the training set:

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_res, y_train_res = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

# 7. Limitations and Future Development Directions

Although the focus on data processing and feature building has significantly improved model performance, the project still faces certain technical hurdles that need to be optimized in the future.

## 7.1. Limitations

**Synthetic Data Bias.** Although PaySim is a high-quality simulated dataset, it still relies on fixed rules. In reality, human fraud behavior is more flexible and unpredictable than automated data generation algorithms, meaning that the generated features may not fully cover all real-world scenarios.

**The scarcity of useful characteristics (Feature Scarcity.** In the original dataset of PaySim, there are a very limited number of columns. In particular, the most important columns are such as `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`, `oldbalanceDest`, and `newbalanceDest`. These columns often contain direct answers to transactions, such as fraudulent transactions typically draining accounts to zero. Removing or limiting the use of these columns to avoid data leakage leaves too few variables, making it difficult to build a comprehensive model.

**Missing identifying and contextual information (Contextual Data Gap).** The dataset lacks crucial information such as geographical location (IP/GPS), device ID, login history, or the frequency of past transactions by the user. Without this contextual information, relying solely on the amount and type of transaction makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between a large, legitimate transaction and a fraudulent one.

**Reliance on domain expertise.** The techniques employed in this project are primarily based on statistical observations. However, to detect complex forms of money laundering or fraud via social media, the system requires a deeper integration of data and expertise from financial/legal professionals.

## 7.2. Future Improvements

To enhance the value of the data processing workflow, the following areas of improvement will be prioritized:

**Automated Feature Engineering.** Apply tools such asFeaturetoolsor Deep Learning algorithmsAutoencoders) to automatically extract latent features that the human eye or conventional statistical analysis might miss.

**Entity and Relationship Analysis (Graph Features).** Instead of treating each transaction as independent, the future direction will build characteristics based on graphs. Calculating metrics such as node degree or centrality between accounts will help identify organized crime networks.

**Feature Selection Optimization.** Using advanced techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or Boruta to remove confounding features, retaining only variables that truly contribute to the model, thereby making the model more streamlined and faster.

**Data/Concept Drift Processing.** Develop a process to monitor changes in data distribution over time. When features no longer retain their original categorical value, the system will automatically trigger a feature reengineering process to adapt to new fraud schemes.

# 9. Conclusion

The project demonstrated that in fraud detection, the features’ quality is just as important as the algorithms themselves. Through the EDA process, we found that fraudulent transactions typically fall into two categories: `TRANSFER` and `CASH_OUT`. And focusing on exploiting the relationships between the few remaining variables helped optimize the model's classification capabilities.

The comparison results show that the model trained on the processed dataset and with feature extraction (Feature Engineering) has superior accuracy (F1-Score) compared to using raw data. The creation of variables such as `isErrorOrg` and `isErrorDest`, has helped the model capture anomalies that individual variables cannot reveal.

A data-centric approach helps businesses better understand customer behavior instead of treating machine learning models as a black box. This allows banks to build rule-based systems combined with AI in a transparent manner, thereby minimizing financial risks and protecting brand reputation.
